                                      <p>Workers spend 90,000 hours or 50% of waking hours at the workplace (Thomson, 2016). A report by Gallup in 2021 on “The State of the Global Workforce” cites that negative emotions such as worry, stress and sadness among employees reached record levels in 2020. In addition, Gallup found that nearly 7 in 10 employees are struggling or suffering rather than thriving in their overall lives. Eighty percent (80%) are not engaged or are actively disengaged at work, costing the global economy $ 8.1 trillion in lost productivity each year! According to Galuup, this problem has been existing since a decade and before the  Covid-!9 Pandemic</p>
                                      <p>A survey on 1,500 leaders in 46 countries in 2020,  found that 89% of the respondents said that work was getting worse and 62% indicated that they were experiencing burnout (Moss, 2020). A 2021 research study on workplace stress on human resources leaders in Nairobi Metropolis found that 89% of the respondents showed elevated levels of stress. The study also found positive correlations between workplace stress and anxiety, depression and substance use (Alibhai et al., 2021; 2022).</p>

                           <p>The cost of workplace stress to organisations cannot be understated. Sickness absences, presenteeism (reduction in performance due to health issues), turnover, accidents, injuries, workplace conflict, strained employee relations and insurance premiums has a negative  impact on productivity and resultant performance of organisations together with the burden of cost.</p>
                           <p>Thankfully, this trend can potentially be reversed by creating a culture that maximises the potential and wellbeing of every employee!</p>
